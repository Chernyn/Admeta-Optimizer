# Bidirectional Looking with A Novel Double Exponential Moving Average to Adaptive and Non-adaptive Momentum Optimizers
This project focuses on the optimizer framework Admeta, which has a bidirectional view with forward-looking and backward-looking. For practice, we implement our framework based on RAdam and SGDM and thus propose AdmetaR and AdmetaS.
