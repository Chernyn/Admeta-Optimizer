# Bidirectional Looking with A Novel Double Exponential Moving Average to Adaptive and Non-adaptive Momentum Optimizers
This project focuses on the optimizer framework Admeta, which has a bidirectional view with forward-looking and backward-looking. For practice, we implement our framework on RAdam and SGDM and propose AdmetaR and AdmetaS. The experiments we conduct are CV, NLP and Audio Classification. Detailed codes for the algorithm and the experiment settings can be seen in the file.
